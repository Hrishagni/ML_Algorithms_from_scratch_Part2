## Single Neural Network and Deep Neural Network on MNIST and Celebrity Face Dataset

In this repository, we have answered the following questions:

• How Neural Network works and use Feed Forward, Back Propagation to implement Neural Network?
• How to setup a Machine Learning experiment on real data?
• How regularization plays a role in the bias-variance tradeoff?
• How to use TensorFlow library to deploy deep neural networks and understand how having multiple
hidden layers can improve the performance of the neural network?
• How to use TensorFlow library to deploy convolutional neural networks and understand the benefit of
convolutional neural network compared to fully connected neural network?

Everything is accomplished in Python using basic libraries and Tensorflow for the model building part. Kindly leave a feedback if you think we could do better.
